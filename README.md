# DARKLITE-CLI-Toolkit
A lightweight command-line security toolkit with password generation, brute-force detection, phishing detection, port scanning, and firewall checking.

DarkLite CLI Toolkit is a lightweight command-line security toolkit designed for educational and portfolio purposes.  
This project was inspired by a senior project, but has been significantly modified and enhanced with new features and improvements implemented by me and my group members.  

It helps users perform common security tasks including password generation, brute-force detection, phishing URL detection, port scanning simulation, and firewall rule checking — all within a simple CLI interface.

Password Generator: Create secure passwords with options for uppercase, lowercase, digits, and symbols.  
Brute Force Detection: Simulates login attempts and detects multiple failed attempts.  
Phishing URL Detector: Identifies potentially malicious URLs based on common phishing keywords.  
Port Scan Simulator: Detects aggressive scanning patterns and logs results.  
Firewall Rule Checker: Monitors network actions and logs allowed or blocked traffic.  
Session Summary & Alerts: Keeps track of all actions performed in a session.  

All features are original enhancements and modifications made to the project inspired by a senior, demonstrating my practical development skills.

Running the Project:
The project can run on Visual Studio.  
Note: Some ASCII graphics may not display correctly in certain IDEs.  
For the full ASCII visual experience, it is recommended to run it on an online compiler like [JDoodle](https://www.jdoodle.com/).
